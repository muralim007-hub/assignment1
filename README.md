# assignment1
Task1:
Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
	Addition
	Subtraction
	Multiplication
	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.


input() asks the user to type something.
By default, input() returns a string, so int() converts it into an integer.
Example: If the user types 5, num1 becomes 5.
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2
division = num1 / num2
- + → Adds the two numbers.
- - → Subtracts the second number from the first.
- * → Multiplies the two numbers.
- / → Divides the first number by the second (result is a float)
- print() displays the text and the calculated result.
- Example output if num1 = 10 and num2 = 2:

get input from user 1st name and last name then print "Hello",name1,"welcome to python program"
first_name=input("Enter your first name: ")
